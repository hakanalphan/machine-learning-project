During the BTK Academy bootcamp and my personal development, I focused on various projects and studies related to machine learning and data science applications. Here is a detailed summary of these activities and projects:

1. Introduction to Machine Learning
We learned the fundamentals of machine learning, algorithms, and applications. This included supervised and unsupervised learning, covering techniques such as regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction.

2. Data Preprocessing
We mastered data preprocessing, a critical step in any machine learning project. This involved handling missing values, data normalization, and data transformation techniques. We used libraries such as pandas and scikit-learn to perform these tasks.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We conducted EDA on various datasets to discover patterns, detect anomalies, and test hypotheses. We used tools like matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas to extract insights from the data.

4. Building Machine Learning Models
We built and evaluated various machine learning models using scikit-learn. These models included:

Linear Regression: For predicting continuous variables.
Logistic Regression: For binary classification tasks.
Decision Trees and Random Forests: For both regression and classification problems.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): For classification tasks.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): For both classification and regression.
5. Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning
We learned how to evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC. Additionally, we explored hyperparameter tuning techniques like Grid Search and Random Search to optimize model performance.

6. Deep Learning with TensorFlow and Keras
We transitioned to deep learning, understanding the basics of neural networks. Using TensorFlow and Keras, we built and trained the following models:

Feedforward Neural Networks: For basic classification and regression tasks.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): For image classification tasks.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks: For time series and sequential data.
7. Transfer Learning and Fine-Tuning
We explored transfer learning, using pre-trained models like ResNet50 and VGG16 to solve new problems with limited data. We learned how to fine-tune these models to improve their performance on specific tasks, such as brain tumor classification.

8. Ensemble Methods
We studied ensemble methods, which combine multiple models to improve performance. Our projects included:

Bagging: Techniques like Random Forests that combine multiple decision trees.
Boosting: Techniques such as AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting.
Stacking: Combining different models like Random Forest and Logistic Regression using a meta-model.
9. Project: Brain Tumor Classification
One of our significant projects was classifying brain tumors using transfer learning. We compared the performance of ResNet50 and VGG16 models:

Data Preparation: Preprocessing MRI images and augmenting the data.
Model Training: Using transfer learning with pre-trained ResNet50 and VGG16 models.
Fine-Tuning: Adjusting model parameters to improve performance.
Evaluation: Determining the best model using metrics like training and validation accuracy, loss, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix.
10. Model Deployment and Presentation
We learned how to deploy machine learning models using tools like Flask and Streamlit. This enabled us to create web applications that could make real-time predictions on new data.

11. Capstone Project: Fashion Recommendation System
Our capstone project involved building a fashion recommendation system:

Feature Extraction: Using CNNs to extract features from images.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommending items based on feature similarity.
User-Based Filtering: Recommending items based on user-item interactions.
Hybrid Methods: Combining content-based and user-based filtering for better recommendations.
Evaluation: Assessing the system's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Through these projects and activities, we gained practical experience in machine learning and data science, and developed a deeper understanding of how to effectively solve real-world problems.
